                        <p>I started learning to design and develop websites recently, and I am still learning how to design the backend of websites using Express.js, 
                            JavaScript, etc. However, I do enjoy designing the front-end of websites too!

                        <p>I started learning to code when I was 12 years old because I wanted to develop my own video games. Over time, I have gained a wealth 
                            of experience in various programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, etc. I also have a knack for Problem Solving!</p>

                        <p>A website that suggests customized skin care products to users based on a small survey 
                            about their skin issues. Users are also given an appointment with top-rated Dermato- logists.
                            Based on a DBMS concept, the website which is still under development, is ready to view as a static website.

                            that you need to know about me and my ongoing projects. You may also contact me via the website. The website 
                            is very minimal and I have used only HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create it!

                        <p>Playing Drums can be fun. Go ahead and try this digital one made by me as a part of my course! You can 
                            either click or press the corresponding keyboard keys to play the drum. This simple website uses 
                            Javascript to add event and key listeners to different buttons and play sounds.

                        <h3>Tindog</h3>
                        <p> A tinder website for Dogs. Yes, you heard that right! Your dog shall never feel lonely and 
                            always have company because we got your dog's back. Woof woof! This is a static website inspired by tinder
                            and has made great use of Bootstrap-5 components to make the website look modern.

                            In this game you have to remember the patterns made by the computer and verify the pattern from the beginning
                            with a new click every level! This website uses basic concepts of JavaScript.

                        <p>A very basic CV made naively. This was the first portfolio/CV that I made during my course. The website only uses 
                             HTML and CSS. However, it looks very modern, clean and minimal with an eye-catching color palette.
